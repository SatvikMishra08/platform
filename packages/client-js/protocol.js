// Side-effect-free re-export of the wire-protocol model types and their fromJSON parsers, with
// no transport code — so a wrapping backend and its own front end can share these types without
// pulling in DialogueBranchClient/fetch at all. See #88's Scope section for the rationale.
//
// One exception: Reply has no fromJSON of its own — it's never meant to be instantiated
// directly (see its own docs); use BasicReply.fromJSON/AutoForwardReply.fromJSON, or
// DialogueStep.fromJSON, which already dispatches between them for you when parsing a full step.
